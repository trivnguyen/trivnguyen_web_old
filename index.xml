      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my project for LIGO SURF Summer 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: We apply long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks as a time-series regression analysis technique to filter instrumental noises from gravitational-wave detectors at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Unlike traditional neural networks, LSTM networks store and use information from their past inputs, thus robust in handling sequential data like gravitational-wave signals. Once trained, an LSTM network should be able to learn, predict, and subtract both the linear and non-linear noise coupling mechanisms, given there exist a set of witness channels monitoring these noises. The result would improve LIGO&amp;rsquo;s sensitivity, most greatly at the low-frequency limit 20-100 Hz where noise features are expected to be easier to learn, and allow the detection of gravitational-wave sources currently below the noise floor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The early universe consists of a hot and dense photon-baryon plasma. Small density fluctuations in the plasma give
rise to acoustic sound waves. These sound waves are driven by radiation pressure and propagate at a relativistic
speed. About 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe is cool enough for free electrons to be captured
by protons to form neutral hydrogen atoms. These newly-formed hydrogen atoms do not interact strongly with photons, and,
as a result, photons decouple from the matter. No longer supported by radiation pressure, the baryon sound waves
halt, producing density bumps, often called the &lt;strong&gt;baryon acoustic oscillations&lt;/strong&gt; (BAOs), at about 150 Mpc detectable in
the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and in the distribution of galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because BAOs create an excess of galaxies at about 150 Mpc, they can be detected by studying at the large-scale clustering
of galaxies. To do this, physicists often use the spatial two-point correlation function (TPCF). The TPCF is a
mathematical tool to contrast between the observed distribution of galaxies and the distribution in which all galaxies
are uniformly distributed over the observed volume (referred to as the random distribution). It describes the excess
probability (observed over random) of finding two galaxies separated by some separation variables
(e.g. distance, angle). With this, BAOs should create a small bump in the spatial TPCF at about 150 Mpc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KITCAT, short for the Kd-tree Implementation for Two-point Correlation AlgoriThm, is a simple and fast tool to compute
the 1-D and 2-D spatial TPCF of galaxies. By assuming the random distribution can be separated into angular variables
(declination and right ascension) and redshift, KITCAT uses convolution of probability distributions to accelerate
the computation of the TPCF. Thanks to this, KITCAT also allows for a fast and flexible scan over the cosmological
parameter space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, refer to &lt;a href=&#34;kitcat.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; on which KITCAT is based.&lt;/p&gt;
