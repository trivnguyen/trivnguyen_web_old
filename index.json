Axions are a light dark matter candidate, and their existence is well-motivated as a solution to the strong CP problem. In a supernova, axions behave much like neutrinos, efficiently removing energy from the explosion and cooling the system. As a result, neutrino production in an SN II is suppressed in the presence of axions, mainly affecting the seconds-long tail of the SN II neutrino light curve. The IceCube Observatory is sensitive to large numbers of MeV neutrinos from an SN II, which produce a collective rise in the hit rates of all photomultipliers in the detector. We present a shape analysis that can be used with IceCube data to discriminate the axion production scenario from standard SN II models.","tags":["IceCube","Supernova","Neutrino","Axion","High-energy Astrophysics","Bayesian Statistics"],"title":"Estimating the Sensitivity of IceCube to Signatures of Axion Production in a Galactic Supernova","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detects GWs by measuring the induced differential arm length between its two perpendicular arms. Since its sensitivity upgrade in 2016, LIGO has successfully detected many GW sources from black-hole to neutron-star mergers. However, due to a number of noise sources, the detectors are currently operating below their design sensitivity. These sources are instrumental and environmental effects, each coupling to the signal via a different (both linear and non-linear) mechanism.\n LIGO Livingston Noise Budget. Source.   LIGO currently relies on the Wiener filter to remove noise sources. However, the Wiener filter fails to remove the non-linear contributions. Characterizing these non-linear contributions and removing them using standard statistical and signal processing techniques can be challenging if not impossible because the mechanisms are often complex and involved multiple noise channels. In this study, we use a machine learning algorithm called the Long Short-Term Memory neural network to learn and filter out these non-linear noise sources.\n Schematic of an LSTM layer. Source.

Small density fluctuations in the plasma give rise to acoustic sound waves. These sound waves are driven by radiation pressure and propagate at a relativistic speed. About 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe is cool enough for free electrons to be captured by protons to form neutral hydrogen atoms. These newly-formed hydrogen atoms do not interact strongly with photons, and, as a result, photons decouple from the matter. No longer supported by radiation pressure, the baryon sound waves halt, producing density bumps, often called the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), at about $100 h^{-1}Mpc$ detectable in the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and in the distribution of galaxies.\n Evolution of the density profile due to acoustic sound waves in the early universe. Source.   Because BAOs create an excess of galaxies at about $100 h^{-1}Mpc$, they can be detected by studying at the large-scale clustering of galaxies. To do this, physicists often use the spatial two-point correlation function (TPCF). The TPCF is a mathematical tool to contrast between the observed distribution of galaxies and the distribution in which all galaxies are uniformly distributed over the observed volume (referred to as the random distribution). It describes the excess probability (observed over random) of finding two galaxies separated by some separation variables (e.g. distance, angle). With this, BAOs should create a small bump in the spatial TPCF at about 150 Mpc.\n BAOs create a bump in the spatial TPCF at the $100h^{-1}Mpc$. Source.   KITCAT, short for the Kd-tree Implementation for Two-point Correlation AlgoriThm, is a simple and fast tool to compute the 1-D and 2-D spatial TPCF of galaxies. By assuming the random distribution can be separated into angular variables (declination and right ascension) and redshift, KITCAT uses convolution of probability distributions to accelerate the computation of the TPCF. Thanks to this, KITCAT also allows for a fast and flexible scan over the cosmological parameter space.\nFor more information, refer to this paper on which KITCAT is based.\nFor KITCAT v2.0.0: Github, Zenodo\n","date":1555387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555387200,"objectID":"ba757552993731f3437008045e0b12d2","permalink":"https://trivnguyen.github.io/project/kitcat/","publishdate":"2019-04-16T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/kitcat/","section":"project","summary":"Accelerating the calculation of the galactic two-point correlation function with k-d tree.","tags":["Cosmology","Algorithm","Two-point Correlation","Baryon Acoustic Oscillation","DESI","SDSS","BOSS","Large-scale Structure"],"title":"KITCAT","type":"project"},{"authors":["Tri Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547826000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547826000,"objectID":"85b7142e9f8eeb40f6fc274debbab3e8","permalink":"https://trivnguyen.github.io/talk/aas2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-19T10:14:59-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/aas2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Since the sensitivity upgrade in 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected a number of black-hole and neutron star mergers. However, since strong sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produce a typical displacement of about 10-18 m (about 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a proton), techniques to reduce and filter instrumental and environmental noise have become increasingly important for the detection of weaker and more distant sources. Our group applied the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model, a subset of machine learning algorithms (MLAs), to noise regression analysis at LIGO. We used LSTMs because they are robust in handling sequential data. Given the time series from the GW and witness channels, the network predicts and subsequently subtracts background noise over a frequency band. Furthermore, unlike the current noise filtering technique, the Wiener filter, non-parametric MLAs like LSTMs, once trained, are capable of learning both the linear and nonlinear noise coupling mechanisms. For the linear contribution, the network matches the subtraction power of the Wiener filter. For the nonlinear contribution, the network performs well on generated mock data. Our framework is generic enough to be applied to a wide variety of series regression problems in many areas of science.","tags":["Gravitational Waves","LIGO","LSTM","Machine Learning","Detector Characterization"],"title":"Extending the reach of gravitational-wave detectors with machine learning","type":"talk"}]
