Here we discuss a novel implementation and deployment of deep learning inference for real-time data denoising and astrophysical source identification. This objective is accomplished using a generic inference-as-a-service model capable of adapting to the future needs of gravitational-wave data analysis. The implementation allows seamless incorporation of hardware accelerators and also enables the use of commercial or private as-a-service computing.

There are 35 compact binary coalescence candidates identified by at least one of our search algorithms with a probability of astrophysical origin pastro0.5. Of these, 18 were previously reported as low-latency public alerts, and 17 are reported here for the first time. Based upon estimates for the component masses, our O3b candidates with pastro0.5 are consistent with gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes or neutron star-black hole binaries, and we identify none from binary neutron stars. However, from the gravitational-wave data alone, we are not able to measure matter effects that distinguish whether the binary components are neutron stars or black holes. The range of inferred component masses is similar to that found with previous catalogs, but the O3b candidates include the first confident observations of neutron star-black hole binaries. Including the 35 candidates from O3b in addition to those from GWTC-2.1, GWTC-3 contains 90 candidates found by our analysis with pastro0.5 across the first three observing runs. These observations of compact binary coalescences present an unprecedented view of the properties of black holes and neutron stars.","tags":[],"title":"GWTC-3: Compact Binary Coalescences Observed by LIGO and Virgo During the Second Part of the Third Observing Run","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rich Ormiston","**Tri Nguyen**","Michael Coughlin","Rana X.

In addition to the stellar-mass black hole and neutron star mergers already detected, many more are below the surface of the noise, available for detection if the noise is reduced enough. Our method (DeepClean) applies machine-learning algorithms to gravitational-wave detector data and data from on-site sensors monitoring the instrument to reduce the noise in the time series due to instrumental artifacts and environmental contamination. This framework is generic enough to subtract linear, nonlinear, and nonstationary coupling mechanisms. It may also provide handles in learning about the mechanisms which are not currently understood to be limiting detector sensitivities. The robustness of the noise-reduction technique in its ability to efficiently remove noise with no unintended effects on gravitational-wave signals is also addressed through software signal injection and parameter estimation of the recovered signal. It is shown that the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the injected signal is enhanced by 21.6 /% and the recovered parameters are consistent with the injected set. We present the performance of this algorithm on linear and nonlinear noise sources and discuss its impact on astrophysical searches by gravitational-wave detectors.","tags":[],"title":"Noise reduction in gravitational-wave data via deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tri Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567310400,"objectID":"70f6f63572e499531312c760d6780c51","permalink":"https://trivnguyen.github.io/talk/fastml/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/fastml/","section":"talk","summary":"Since the sensitivity upgrade in 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected a number of black-hole and neutron star mergers. However, since strong sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produce a typical displacement of about 10-18 m (about 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a proton), techniques to reduce and filter instrumental and environmental noise have become increasingly important for the detection of weaker and more distant sources. Our group applied the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model, a subset of machine learning algorithms (MLAs), to noise regression analysis at LIGO. We used LSTMs because they are robust in handling sequential data. Given the time series from the GW and witness channels, the network predicts and subsequently subtracts background noise over a frequency band. Furthermore, unlike the current noise filtering technique, the Wiener filter, non-parametric MLAs like LSTMs, once trained, are capable of learning both the linear and nonlinear noise coupling mechanisms. For the linear contribution, the network matches the subtraction power of the Wiener filter. For the nonlinear contribution, the network performs well on generated mock data. Our framework is generic enough to be applied to a wide variety of series regression problems in many areas of science.","tags":["Gravitational Waves","LIGO","LSTM","Machine Learning","Detector Characterization","Caltech SURF","AAS"],"title":"Deep Cleaning for Gravitational-wave Data","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detects GWs by measuring the induced differential arm length between its two perpendicular arms. Since its sensitivity upgrade in 2016, LIGO has successfully detected many GW sources from black-hole to neutron-star mergers.

These sources are instrumental and environmental effects, each coupling to the signal via a different (both linear and non-linear) mechanism.\n LIGO Livingston Noise Budget. Source.   LIGO currently relies on the Wiener filter to remove noise sources. However, the Wiener filter fails to remove the non-linear contributions. Characterizing these non-linear contributions and removing them using standard statistical and signal processing techniques can be challenging if not impossible because the mechanisms are often complex and involve multiple noise channels.

Small density fluctuations in the plasma give rise to acoustic sound waves. These sound waves are driven by radiation pressure and propagate at a relativistic speed. About 400,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe is cool enough for free electrons to be captured by protons to form neutral hydrogen atoms. These newly-formed hydrogen atoms do not interact strongly with photons, and, as a result, photons decouple from the matter. No longer supported by radiation pressure, the baryon sound waves halt, producing density bumps, often called the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), at about $100 h^{-1}Mpc$ detectable in the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and in the distribution of galaxies.\n Evolution of the density profile due to acoustic sound waves in the early universe. Source.   Because BAOs create an excess of galaxies at about $100 h^{-1}Mpc$, they can be detected by studying at the large-scale clustering of galaxies. To do this, physicists often use the spatial two-point correlation function (TPCF). The TPCF is a mathematical tool to contrast between the observed distribution of galaxies and the distribution in which all galaxies are uniformly distributed over the observed volume (referred to as the random distribution). It describes the excess probability (observed over random) of finding two galaxies separated by some separation variables (e.g. distance, angle). With this, BAOs should create a small bump in the spatial TPCF at about 150 Mpc.\n BAOs create a bump in the spatial TPCF at the $100h^{-1}Mpc$. Source.   KITCAT, short for the Kd-tree Implementation for Two-point Correlation AlgoriThm, is a simple and fast tool to compute the 1-D and 2-D spatial TPCF of galaxies. By assuming the random distribution can be separated into angular variables (declination and right ascension) and redshift, KITCAT uses convolution of probability distributions to accelerate the computation of the TPCF. Thanks to this, KITCAT also allows for a fast and flexible scan over the cosmological parameter space.\nFor more information, refer to this paper on which KITCAT is based.\nFor KITCAT v2.0.0: Github, Zenodo\n","date":1555387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555387200,"objectID":"ba757552993731f3437008045e0b12d2","permalink":"https://trivnguyen.github.io/project/kitcat/","publishdate":"2019-04-16T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/kitcat/","section":"project","summary":"Accelerating the calculation of the galactic two-point correlation function with k-d tree.","tags":["Cosmology","Algorithm","Two-point Correlation","Baryon Acoustic Oscillation","DESI","SDSS","BOSS","Large-scale Structure"],"title":"KITCAT","type":"project"}]
