This objective is accomplished using a generic inference-as-a-service model capable of adapting to the future needs of gravitational-wave data analysis. The implementation allows seamless incorporation of hardware accelerators and also enables the use of commercial or private as-a-service computing.

Updating the previous GWTC-2.1, we present candidate gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences during the second half of the third observing run (O3b) between 1 November 2019, 15:00 UTC and 27 March 2020, 17:00 UTC. There are 35 compact binary coalescence candidates identified by at least one of our search algorithms with a probability of astrophysical origin pastro0.5. Of these, 18 were previously reported as low-latency public alerts, and 17 are reported here for the first time. Based upon estimates for the component masses, our O3b candidates with pastro0.5 are consistent with gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes or neutron star-black hole binaries, and we identify none from binary neutron stars. However, from the gravitational-wave data alone, we are not able to measure matter effects that distinguish whether the binary components are neutron stars or black holes. The range of inferred component masses is similar to that found with previous catalogs, but the O3b candidates include the first confident observations of neutron star-black hole binaries. Including the 35 candidates from O3b in addition to those from GWTC-2.1, GWTC-3 contains 90 candidates found by our analysis with pastro0.5 across the first three observing runs. These observations of compact binary coalescences present an unprecedented view of the properties of black holes and neutron stars.","tags":[],"title":"GWTC-3: Compact Binary Coalescences Observed by LIGO and Virgo During the Second Part of the Third Observing Run","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tri Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603166400,"objectID":"f598657760b59c988c1602de7c76b7a2","permalink":"https://trivnguyen.github.io/talk/ncsa/","publishdate":"2020-10-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ncsa/","section":"talk","summary":"In the next few years, an international network of gravitational-wave detectors will create a data boom in gravitational-wave data and provide scientists with many opportunities for physics discoveries. On average, every day we will expect to see one gravitational-wave signal and many more false triggers. Therefore, the ability to quickly and reliably extract these signals from noise is extremely important for the future of gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astronomy. In LIGO, noise regression techniques are used to subtract noise artifacts to improve the ability to detect and extract information from gravitational-wave signals. In this talk, I present DeepClean, which is a neural network-based noise regression algorithm that can subtract non-linear and non-stationary noise in the LIGO detector. DeepClean is fast enough to perform in real-time, which can drastically improve the sensitivity to faint, time-sensitive gravitational-wave signals such as neutron star mergers.

Understanding the distribution of DM in these systems can be used to pin down microphysical DM interactions that influence the formation and evolution of structures in our Universe. Unfortunately, current observations and current analysis techniques (e.g. Jeans dynamical modeling) fail to pin down the exact DM density profiles in these systems.\nFor example, an ongoing puzzle in cosmology is the so-called cusp-core problem, referring to whether the inner density profile of DM in dwarf galaxies is a cusp (steeply rising) or a core (flattened). N-body simulations using Lambda-CDM cosmology suggest that in the absence of baryonic (standard) physics, cold DM halos follow the cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White density (NFW), which is characterized by a steep rise in the density. However, recent measurements of stelliar dynamics suggest that these systems could instead have a flattened density profile at their center, also known as a core.\nWith Prof. Lina Necib and Dr. Siddharth Mishra-Sharma, I develop a new approach for inferring the dark matter density profiles of dwarf galaxies from the obseravable kinematics of stars bound to these systems using graph-based machine learning. Using simulated dwarf galaxies from StarSampler as training data, we contruct a K-Nearest-Neighbor graph for each galaxy, pass it through a Chebyshev Convolutional Neural Network to extract its features, and use these features as conditions for a Normalizng Flow. This allows us to not only predict the dark matter parameters but also their posterior distributions. Below is an example of the posterior distribution predicted by our method:\n An example posterior distribution of the dark matter parameters and the light profile parameters as predicted by our method.

In addition to the stellar-mass black hole and neutron star mergers already detected, many more are below the surface of the noise, available for detection if the noise is reduced enough. Our method (DeepClean) applies machine-learning algorithms to gravitational-wave detector data and data from on-site sensors monitoring the instrument to reduce the noise in the time series due to instrumental artifacts and environmental contamination. This framework is generic enough to subtract linear, nonlinear, and nonstationary coupling mechanisms. It may also provide handles in learning about the mechanisms which are not currently understood to be limiting detector sensitivities. The robustness of the noise-reduction technique in its ability to efficiently remove noise with no unintended effects on gravitational-wave signals is also addressed through software signal injection and parameter estimation of the recovered signal. It is shown that the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the injected signal is enhanced by 21.6 /% and the recovered parameters are consistent with the injected set. We present the performance of this algorithm on linear and nonlinear noise sources and discuss its impact on astrophysical searches by gravitational-wave detectors.","tags":[],"title":"Noise reduction in gravitational-wave data via deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tri Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567310400,"objectID":"70f6f63572e499531312c760d6780c51","permalink":"https://trivnguyen.github.io/talk/fastml/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/fastml/","section":"talk","summary":"Since the sensitivity upgrade in 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected a number of black-hole and neutron star mergers. However, since strong sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produce a typical displacement of about 10-18 m (about 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a proton), techniques to reduce and filter instrumental and environmental noise have become increasingly important for the detection of weaker and more distant sources. Our group applied the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model, a subset of machine learning algorithms (MLAs), to noise regression analysis at LIGO. We used LSTMs because they are robust in handling sequential data. Given the time series from the GW and witness channels, the network predicts and subsequently subtracts background noise over a frequency band. Furthermore, unlike the current noise filtering technique, the Wiener filter, non-parametric MLAs like LSTMs, once trained, are capable of learning both the linear and nonlinear noise coupling mechanisms. For the linear contribution, the network matches the subtraction power of the Wiener filter. For the nonlinear contribution, the network performs well on generated mock data. Our framework is generic enough to be applied to a wide variety of series regression problems in many areas of science.","tags":["Gravitational Waves","LIGO","LSTM","Machine Learning","Detector Characterization","Caltech SURF","AAS"],"title":"Deep Cleaning for Gravitational-wave Data","type":"talk"}]
