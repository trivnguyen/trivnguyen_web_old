Unlike traditional neural networks, LSTM networks store and use information from their past inputs, thus robust in handling sequential data like gravitational-wave signals. Once trained, an LSTM network should be able to learn, predict, and subtract both the linear and non-linear noise coupling mechanisms, given there exist a set of witness channels monitoring these noises. The result would improve LIGO\u0026rsquo;s sensitivity, most greatly at the low-frequency limit 20-100 Hz where noise features are expected to be easier to learn, and allow the detection of gravitational-wave sources currently below the noise floor.\n","date":1555387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555387200,"objectID":"fc60856ccf2a8dbb3e422c7fbee74235","permalink":"https://trivnguyen.github.io/project/deepclean/","publishdate":"2019-04-16T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/deepclean/","section":"project","summary":"Using LSTM network to learn and subtract non-linear noise in LIGO detectors.","tags":["Gravitational Waves","Machine Learning","LIGO","Detector Characterization","Neural Network","LSTM"],"title":"DeepClean - A Noise Regression Framework","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Algorithm described in: A Computationally Efficient Approach for Calculating Galaxy Two-Point Correlations\nKITCAT v2.0.0: Github, Zenodo\nKITCAT, or the Kd-tree Implementation for Two-point Correlation AlgoriThm, is\u0026hellip;\n","date":1555387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555387200,"objectID":"ba757552993731f3437008045e0b12d2","permalink":"https://trivnguyen.github.io/project/kitcat/","publishdate":"2019-04-16T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/kitcat/","section":"project","summary":"Calculating the spatial two-point correlation function using k-d tree algorithm.","tags":["Cosmology","Algorithm","Two-point Correlation Function","Baryon Acoustic Oscillation","DESI"],"title":"KITCAT","type":"project"}]
